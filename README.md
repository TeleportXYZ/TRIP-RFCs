# Welcome to TRIP

## What's TRIP?

TRIP is an open and interoperable protocol for ridesharing.

TRIP enables local, lean rideshare companies to work together and form a global network that benefits drivers, riders, and regional economies while being self-governed by the participants.

## RFC Process

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for changes to TRIP (such as new features) so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction of the project.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the TRIP community.
